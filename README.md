# Death rates vs Economy during the pandemic
Analyzing multiple datasets to examine the effect of the pandemic on different countries' death rates and economy.

The aim of this research is to determine a set of countries which could manage to:

1- flatten the curve,

2- maintain their economy relatively stable during the lockdown period and

3- beat the virus with a relatively low death rate.

and compare between them in terms of different aspects(length of lockdown period, time needed to flatten the curve, lowest and highest point of their index in the stock market,..)

A detailed report with charts is attached.

Running the Code:

-LockdownAnalysis.py: this code generate useful plots and data which explain the diffrent kinds of Lockdown used in each country.
To run the code you should set value of the variable "path" to  the local path of the project on your computer.

-FactorCalculation.py & FactorLastDay.py: responsible for reproducing all results in the "Factor results" directory.
All pathes used within these scripts are relative to the directory of the project. They should run without any path editing if the code was run within the same directory of the cloned repository.
