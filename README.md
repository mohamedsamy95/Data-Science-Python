# Death rates vs Economy during the pandemic
Analyzing multiple datasets to examine the effect of the pandemic on different countries' death rates and economy.

The aim of this research is to determine a set of countries which could manage to:

1- flatten the curve,

2- maintain their economy relatively stable during the lockdown period and

3- beat the virus with a relatively low death rate.

and compare between them in terms of different aspects(length of lockdown period, time needed to flatten the curve, lowest and highest point of their index in the stock market,..)

A detailed report with charts is attached.
